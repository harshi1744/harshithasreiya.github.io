## 🚀 Who I Am

I’m a curious mind fueled by data and driven by impact. I believe every dataset tells a story, and I’m here to translate those stories into decisions that matter. Whether it’s unveiling hidden patterns in child malnutrition or crafting AI tools that rethink recruitment — I bring **heart, hustle, and a hacker’s mindset** to every challenge.

Currently, I’m sharpening my analytics sword through an MS in Business Analytics, specializing in:

- Crafting narratives with data visualization & business intelligence  
- Engineering AI solutions that explain themselves (yes, XAI is a thing!)  
- Turning raw data into actionable insights that humanize complexity  

My mission? To partner with visionary teams and build smarter, fairer, and more transparent AI-powered solutions.
