# 🧠 Where Data Becomes Decisions Designing Analytics, Intelligence & Explainable AI Systems

> I don’t analyze data to explain the past.  
> I design systems that help people make better decisions and trust them.

## 👋 Hi, I’m Harshitha

I’m a **Business Analytics graduate student** who works at the intersection of  
**data, systems, and real-world impact**.

What excites me most isn’t discovering insights 
it’s **building decision systems** that are:

- understandable  
- scalable  
- ethical  
- and actually used  

📍 Based in the United States  
🎓 **M.S. Business Analytics — University of North Texas**  
🚀 **Seeking full-time roles starting December 2025**

## 🧭 How I Think About Analytics

Most analytics answers:

> **“What happened?”**

I care more about:

- **What should we do next?**  
- **Why should we trust this result?**  
- **How does this scale beyond one dashboard or one user?**

That’s why my work focuses on:

- 🧠 **Decision Intelligence**, not just reporting  
- 🤖 **Explainable AI**, not black-box predictions  
- ⚙️ **Automation**, not manual workflows  
- 📊 **Business context**, not isolated metrics  

If an insight can’t be **explained** or **acted on** —  
**it isn’t finished.**

## 🧬 What I Build (Not Just What I Know)

Instead of listing tools, here’s what I *build* with them:

- Decision dashboards leadership actually uses  
- AI systems that explain *why* a prediction was made  
- ETL pipelines that remove manual reporting pain  
- Analytics platforms that scale across teams  
- Models designed with ethics, transparency, and trust in mind  

**My tools evolve.  
My thinking stays consistent.**

## 🛡️ Campus Safety Decision Intelligence Platform  
**University of North Texas Police Department**

### 🧠 The Decision
How can leadership proactively allocate resources, staffing, and patrols —  
instead of reacting after incidents occur?

### ⚠️ The Problem
Campus safety data lived across multiple systems with:
- slow manual reporting  
- disconnected datasets  
- limited visibility into trends  

### ⚙️ The System
**INPUTS**
- Offense records  
- Calls for service  
- Community engagement events  
- Time, location, and incident attributes  

**ENGINE**
- Automated ETL pipelines (2023–2025)  
- Feature engineering & temporal analysis  
- Predictive analytics for staffing and planning  

**OUTPUTS**
- Executive dashboards  
- Crime trend intelligence  
- Resource optimization insights  

### 🎯 Why It Mattered
- ⏱️ Reporting reduced from hours to minutes  
- 📊 Improved transparency and accountability  
- 🚓 Enabled proactive, data-backed safety decisions

- Rubric-based, explainable scoring  
- Quantized LLM (Mistral-7B) with RAG  
- Fully offline, privacy-preserving architecture  

**OUTPUTS**
- Ranked candidates with explanations  
- Recruiter-facing AI assistant  
- Defensible hiring decisions  

### 🎯 Why It Mattered
- Faster screening  
- Reduced bias  
- Decisions recruiters can **explain and defend**

- fail audits  
- lose stakeholder trust  

### ⚙️ The System
**ENGINE**
- Supervised & unsupervised ML models  
- Real-time fraud pipeline on cloud infrastructure  
- SHAP & LIME for explainability  

**OUTPUTS**
